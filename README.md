My (Parapando's) version of Wynncraft's (Minecraft server) Distant Horizon (Mod) preloaded chunks (LODs) files.

Quality presets are: Medium. (I also recommend to set the Cave Culling option to "False")

Simply drag files from .zip file (u can get it in "Releases" tab) to your Wynncraft Distant Horizons folder (Simply navigate to your Minecraft game folder and in folder named "Distant_Horizons_server_data" try to find something referencing to "Wynncraft", then just paste the files in overworld folder and that's all).
